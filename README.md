## Android Basic ORM

A Framework that could generate SQLite Tables from classes on your Android App. 
Download here and put on your library dir on the Android App.

To configure you need to have a Class that inherits the abstract class PersistenceManagerFactory. 
```java
public class DemoPersistenceManagerFactory extends PersistenceManagerFactory {

   /** This method list all classes that will be scanned by PersistenceManager **/
	@Override
	public List<Class> registerEntities() {
		List<Class> classes = new ArrayList<Class>();
		classes.add(Entity.class); //Entity is a classe that will be turned into a SQLite Table on Android 
		return classes;
	}


  /** This method contains the name of the database that will be created for the app **/
	@Override
	public String database() {
		return "database_name";
	}

}
```

The scanned classes should have @Id annotation on the field that will be mapped to Primary Key Field on the table generated by the class.
```java
public class Entity implements Serializable{
	
	private static final long serialVersionUID = -5326100016816228468L;
	
	@Id
	private Integer id;
	private String name;
	
	public Integer getId() { return id; }
	public void setId(Integer id) { this.id = id; }
	
	public String getName() { return name; }
	public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
	
	... 
}

```

After all this, to use the framework you will need to have a PersistenceManager's instance.
```java
PersistenceManagerFactory persistenceManagerFactory = new DemoPersistenceManagerFactory();
persistenceManagerFactory.create();
```
